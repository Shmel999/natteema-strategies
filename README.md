# Phil's Custom freqtrade Crypto Trading Strategies

_**I am only periodically developing these strategies because - work, family etc...**_

I recently re-organised all of the strategies. Originally, they were in exchange-based folders (binanceus etc.). This became unwieldly, plus it is now difficult to use multiple exchanges anyway. So, I have moved all of the strategies into new directories based on the underlying family (or group), such as Anomaly, PCA, NNPredict etc.
<br>
```
tree -d -L 1
.
├── Anomaly
├── NNPredict
├── NNTC
├── TSPredict
├── archived
├── binanceus
├── config
├── hyperopts
├── reference
├── scripts
└── utils
```

_archive_ contains abandoned strategies (which are still sometimes useful for cut & paste)
<br>
_binanceus_ is a remnant from when I was running with multiple exchanges (which no longer seems possible). I no longer develop here, but left it for reference



_NOTES_:

- _**Scripts**_: All scripts (in user_data/strategies/scripts) have been updated such that they now take the group name (but the old exchange method will still work)

- _**Binance**_: I live in the USA, and the most exchanges recently blocked API access from here. So, I cannot (
  easily) test the code in any other exchange. I know I could use a VPN, but I'm busy with a bunch of other
  stuff - sorry. <br>
  All strats should work, but you will need to run hyperopt on them to get good hyperparameters

- _**Mac M1**_: My development machine is a Mac M1 laptop. While it is very fast, it does present some challenges in
  terms of packages. See [here](README_MACM1.md) for more details.<br>
  As an aside, all of my scripts are written for _zsh_, not _bash_ (this is the default shell on MacOS, plus the version
  of bash that is pre-installed is very old)

- _**NNPredict**_: this uses neural networks to predict changes in the price of a pair. Timeseries prediction is a
  cutting edge problem, and I do not appear to have solved it! These algorithms perform OK in backtesting, but if you
  look at the details, the predictions are not good. <br>So, I am currently not working on these, but I may circle back
  and apply lessons learned from te NNTC work

- _**Tensorflow**_: several strategies use neural network models implemented using tensorflow (and keras). For some reason, the latest versions of tensorflow dropped support for serialisation of models (at least on MacOS), so hyperopt of these strategies no longer works (because hyperopt saves and restores the strategies via pickle).

## Intro

This folder contains the code for a variety of custom trading strategies for use with
the [freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io/) framework.

Please read through the instructions at https://www.freqtrade.io before attempting to use this software.

Note: I have tried many different strategies, most of which perform quite badly or inconsistently. The abandoned
strategies are in the _archived/_ folder for reference (I sometimes cut & paste pieces of them into new strategies).

I currently focus on strategies that revolve around one of several approaches:

1. creating a model of the expected behaviour and comparing it to the actual behaviour. If the model projects a higher
   price (above a certain margin) then buy, similarly sell if the model predicts a lower price. There are variants that
   use Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT), Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) and Kalman filters. The DWT variants seem to
   perform the best (and are the fastest).
2. Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the dataframe columns, then use that to train
   classifiers, which are then used to predict buys and sells. The PCA analysis is pretty cool because you just add
   indicators and let the PCA reduction figure out which of them are actually important.<br>
   Note that this is quite similar in approach to [freqAI](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/freqai/), but I started it
   before I knew about that, so just kept going (because I find it interesting).<br>
   All of the PCA logic is contained in a base class named PCA. There are several variants (prefixed with PCA_) that try
   out different approaches to identify buy/sell signals that are used for training the classifiers.
3. Use Neural Networks to create trinary classifiers that return a buy/sell prediction.<br>
   Logic is very similar to the PCA classes, and the base class is NNTC (Neural Network Trinary Classifier). The
   internals are a little more complex because the Neural Network code works with 'tensors' rather than dataframes.
   These have to be trained over long time periods because there aren't enough buys/sells otherwise. Models are saved in
   the models/ directory and will be used if present.
4. Neural Network prediction models (NNPredict_*.py)<br>
   Similar to NNBC, but predicts an actual price, rather than a buy/sell recommendation. Same issues as NNBC
5. Anomaly Detection (Anomaly.py)<br>
   The main issue with using neural networks is that there are not many buy/sell recommendations relative to the number
   of samples (typically about 1%). This approach uses various anomaly detection algorithms by training them on
   historical data, which will mostly model the normal cases (no buy or sell). Then we run it against actual data and
   anything identified as an 'anomaly' should be a buy or sell.<br>
   I also combine this with various compression techniques, such as PCA, to make the anomaly detection algorithms more
   efficient.

For the approaches that use Neural Networks (usually with 'NN' somewhere in the name), I have started saving and
reloading models, which are in the _models/_ subdirectory of the exchange folder. These are created by running
_backtest_ over long periods of time, and are then loaded and reused in any other mode (hyperopt, plot, dryrun etc)

All of these strategies use the custom sell/stoploss approach from the Solipsis strategy (by werkrew). This makes a huge
difference in performance, but the downside is that each strategy requires a lot of hyperopt-ing to get decent
performance. Also, I am suspicious that the custom stoploss code is over-fitting, because it has such a drastic effect
on performance and because it doesn't seem to work the same way in dry runs.<br>
I am currently trying to find a simpler custom stoploss approach that transfers better to a live environment
(look in Anomaly.py)

## Disclaimer

These strategies are for educational purposes only

Do not risk money which you are afraid to lose. USE THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE AUTHORS AND ALL AFFILIATES ASSUME
NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR TRADING RESULTS.

Always start by testing strategies using backtesting then run the trading bot in Dry-run mode (live data but simulated
trades). Some instructions on how to do this are provided below.
<br>Never, _ever_, go to live trading without first going through a dry-run - it is not at all uncommon for a strategy
to achieve fantastic results in backtesting, only to perform very badly in a live situation. The main reason for this is
that the backtesting simulation cannot reproduce the behaviour of the live environment. For example, real trades take a
relatively long time and the price can move significantly during that time. Also, market conditions such as trading
volume, spreads, volatility etc. cannot be reproduced from the historical data provided by the exchanges

Do not engage money before you understand how it works and what profit/loss you should expect. Also, do not backtest the
strategies in a period of huge growth (like 2020 for example), when any strategy would do well. I recommend including
periods where the market performed poorly (e.g. May, Nov and Dec 2021)

## List of Strategies

The following is a list of my custom strategies that I am currently testing.

| Strategy    | Description                                                                                                                                                             |

| NNPredict_* | Uses neural network approaches to predict price changes                                                                                                                 |

Please note that you will need both the _.py_ *and* the _.json_ file.

If you know what you are doing, go ahead and use these (but read the section on muliple exchanges first). If not, please
read through the general freqtrade documentation and the guidelines below...

## Multi Exchange Support

Exchanges are where you perform your trades, such as Binance, BinanceUS, FTX, KuCoin etc. Exchanges have different
pairlists, different base currencies and different behaviours, so you really need different parameters for each
exchange. The way I address this is by putting exchange-specific code in a subdirectory below the strategy directory
whose name matches the exchange tag used by freqtrade (e.g. binanceus, kucoin, ftx).
<br>
If you look, you will find files such as DWT.py in each subdirectory. The python files are usually identical across the
exchange directories, but the associated json file
(e.g. DWT.json) contains the exchange-specific data for the strategy, which is typically generated by the
_freqtrade hyperopt_ command (or the hyp_strat.sh script)

<br>
To help with this, I added a bunch of shell scripts in the _user_data/strategies/scripts_ directory:

| Script           | Description                                                                                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| test_strat.sh    | Tests an individual strategy for the specified exchange                                                                  |
| test_exchange.sh | Tests all of the currently active strategies for the specified exchange                                                  |
| test_monthly.sh  | Runs test_exchange.sh over a monthly interval for the past 6 months, shows average performance, and ranks the strategies |
| hyp_strat.sh     | runs hyperopt on an individual strategy for the specified exchange                                                       |
| hyp_exchange.sh  | Runs hyp_strat.sh for all of the currently active strategies for the specified exchange                                  |
| hyp_all.sh       | Runs hyp_exchange.sh for all currently active exchanges (takes a *_very_* long time)                                     |
| run_strat.sh     | Runs a strategy live on the specified exchange, takes care of PYTHONPATH, db-url etc                                     |
| dryrun_strat.sh  | Dry-runs a strategy on the specified exchange, takes care of PYTHONPATH, db-url etc                                      |

Specify the -h option for help.

Please note that all of the _test__\*.sh and _hyp__\*.sh scripts all expect there to be a config file in the exchange
directory that is named in the form:  
_config\_\<exchange\>.json_ (e.g. _config_binanceus.json_)
<br>
The _run_strat.sh_.sh and _dryrun_strat.sh_ scripts expect a 'real' config file that should specify volume filters etc.

I include reference config files for each exchange (in each exchange folder). These use static pairlists since
VolumePairlist does not work for backtesting or hyperopt.
<br>To generate a candidate pairlist use a command such as the following:

> freqtrade test-pairlist -c _\<config\>_

where _\<config\>_ is the 'real' config file that would be used for live or dry runs.
<br>
the command will give a list of pairs that pass the filters. You can then cut&paste the list into your test config file.
Remember to change single quotes (\') to double quotes (\") though.

I do *not* provide example config files for dryrun and live modes, because those have to contain your API keys to use
the exchange. You not include those either if you copy any of this and put it on github.

## Setting Up Your Configuration

See the [freqtrade docs](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/configuration/) for generic instructions.

My environment is set up for multiple exchanges, so it's a bit different. My scripts expect the following:

* an exchange-specific config file in the root _freqtrade_ directory of the form config\_\<exchange\>.json
  (or config_\<exchange\>_\<port\>.json if you want to run multiple strategies on the same exchange)
* an exchange-specific config file in the user_data/strategies/\<exchange\> directory of the form
  config\_\<exchange\>.json

For short strategies, you need to use a different set of pairs. My procedure is to have a separate config file named _
config\_\<exchange\>\_short.json_ Also, see later section

Note: do *_not_* put any exchange trading keys or passwords in the user_data/strategies/\<exchange\> files, as you are
quite likely to share these or put them into github

### Configuration for Short Strategies

Shorting has just (at the time of writing this) been introduced to freqtrade, and requires a different set of pairs and
a different configuration

Copy your working _user_data/strategies/\<exchange\>/config\_\<exchange\>.json_ to *
user_data/strategies/\<exchange\>/config\_\<exchange\>_short.json*

Add the following lines in the main section of your configuration:

> "trading_mode": "futures",
>
>  "margin_mode": "isolated",

You can only use pairs that support margin trading. To find these, run the following command:

> freqtrade list-pairs --exchange _\<exchange\>_ --trading-mode futures

This will give a table of all of the supported pairs. Pay attention to the _Quote_ column and choose the base coin you
want to use (probably _USDT_). Change the _stake_currency_ prameter in your config file to match.
<br>
Now, look at the _Leverage_ column at the end of the table. You can only short pairs where Leverage is > 1, so you have
to remove those from your list (otherwise freqtrade will exit). To do that, try this command:

> freqtrade list-pairs --exchange binanceus --trading-mode futures | grep USDT | awk '$16>1 {print "\""$4"\","}'

But obviously changing USDT and binanceus to whatever you are using

Now, copy that list into your config file _pair\_whitelist_ entry, enable any filters (e.g. _VolumePairList_)
and run:

> freqtrade test-pairlist -c user_data/strategies/binanceus/config_binanceus_short.json

Then, take the output of that and replace the _pair\_whitelist_ entry, disable the filters (i.e. use _StaticPairList_)
and start backtesting

## Downloading Test Data

To run backtest and hyperopt, you need to download data to your local environment.
<br>
You do this using a command like this:

> freqtrade download-data --timerange=_\<timerange\>_ -c _\<config\>_-t 5m 15m 1h 1d

Or, for a specific pair (e.g. BTC/USDT):

> freqtrade download-data --timerange=_\<timerange\>_ -c _\<config\>_-t 5m 15m 1h 1d -p BTC/USDT

Most of the strategies need 5m, 15m and 1h data, but some of the more advanced sell logic also requires 15m, 1h and 1d
data, plus also data for BTC/USD or BTC/USDT (whatever your exchanges uses)

I typically download for the past 180 days, which is the default used by the various scripts.

For convenience, you can also just run :

> zsh user_data/strategies/scripts/download.sh *[\<exchange\>\]*

For short data, you need to specify an additional parameter (--trading-mode futures):

> freqtrade download-data --trading-mode futures --timerange=_\<timerange\>_ -c _\<config\>_-t 5m 15m 1h 1d

Or, just add the --short option:

> zsh user_data/strategies/scripts/download.sh --short *[\<exchange\>\]*

## Backtesting

Backtesting is where you run your strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed.

In all command/shell examples, _\<strategy\>_ is the name of the strategy being used, and _\<timerange\>_ is the range
of time to use for testing (duh).

Examples of _\<timerange\>_ might be:

- _20210501-_       May 1st, 2021 until present date
- _20210603-20210605_   June 3rd 2021 until June 5th 2021

Before you can backtest, you must download data for testing.

It is recommended that you update fairly often (e.g. once per week) and on a limited time range (e.g. the last month).
Optimising results for the past year or 6 months doesn't really help you perform better with the current market
conditions.

Backtesting can be done using the following command:

> freqtrade backtesting -c _\<config\>_ --strategy-path _\<path\>_ --strategy _\<strategy\>_  --timerange=
_\<timerange\>_

Or, you can use a script:

> zsh user_data/strategies/scripts/test_strat.sh _\<exchange\>_ _\<strategy\>_

Use the -h option for options.

*NOTE*: if you get really good results in backtesting (100% or more) then it is highly likely that your strategy is
performing lookahead (using future data). This is remarkably easy to do, since the entire set of test data is present in
the dataframe when your strategy is calculating indicators. So, if you do something like take a mean, find a min/max
etc. then you are operating on the entire data set, not just the older data. To avoid this, either use the TA-lib
functions or process the data through the _rolling_ mechanism.

See [here](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/latest/strategy-customization/#common-mistakes-when-developing-strategies) for (a
little) more information

Also, some example strategies with subtle lookahead bias can be viewed (with an explanation)
at: https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade-strategies/tree/master/user_data/strategies/lookahead_bias

## Hyper-Parameter Optimisation

Run the hyperopt command to search for 'optimal' parameters in your strategy.

The parameters that can be tuned are defined in the strategy using calls such as:

> buy_bb_gain = DecimalParameter(0.01, 0.10, decimals=2, default=0.09, space="buy", load=True, optimize=True)

In this example, the code is telling freqtrade that the strategy has a _buy_ parameter named _buy\_bb\_gain_, which is a
floating point number (Decimal) between 0.01 and 0.1, using 2 decimal places

Note that performance is _dramatically_ affected by the parameters (especially ROI) and timeframe. Also, strategies
tuned for a specific exchange will typically not perform well on other exchanges.

The freqtrade command to run the optimisation is:

> freqtrade hyperopt -c _\<config\>_ --strategy-path _\<path\>_ --strategy _\<strategy\>_  --spaces _\<space\>_
> --hyperopt-loss _\<loss algorithm\>_   --timerange=_\<timerange\>_

where:

_\<space\>_ specifies which space to try and optimise. Typical options are buy, sell, roi, stoploss and trailing. I tend
to _not_ optimise for stoploss, and just set it manually to 10% (-0.1), or 99% for strategies that use dynamic ROI or a
custom stoploss (e.g. FBB_Solipsis)

Or, you can use a script:

> zsh user_data/strategies/scripts/hyp_strat.sh -s "buy sell roi" _\<exchange\>_ _\<strategy\>_

If you have a fast computer, try _--space buy sell_ and then _--spaces sell_, but if you have a slower computer, try
them in sequence.

NOTE: the optimised parameters are written to a json file that matches the strategy file, e.g. DWT.py will produce
DWT.json. freqtrade commands (backtesting, dryrun, live running) will take the parameters from that file. Those
settings *override* any equivalent settings contained in the python file, so if you are changing parameters in the
python code and nothing is happening, check the json file (it took me a while to figure that out)

The optimisation run does not always produce better results, so look carefully). I tend to open the json file before
running the optimisation, copy the contents to the paste buffer, and then paste them back if there was no improvement.

### Stoploss

Just a note (again) that I typically do _not_ optimise for stoploss - I just set it to a fixed number (usually 10%). If
you do optimise it, you will see better results in backtesting. However, my (hard-earned) experience is that this does
not transfer to the real world - what happens is that, with a larger stoploss, one losing trade will typically wipe out
gains from 10 or more winning trades. So, just cut your losses at 10% and move on.

## Hyperopt Loss Functions

freqtrade provides several loss functions for use with hyperopt. Each loss function will evaluate the results from
running the strategy and assign a score based on those results (using profit etc). The hyperopt function basically
starts off with several random combination of input parameters then tweaks them to try and produce lower results from
the loss function (the convention is that lower is better).

_\<loss algorithm\>_ is one of:

- ShortTradeDurHyperOptLoss
- OnlyProfitHyperOptLoss
- SharpeHyperOptLoss
- SharpeHyperOptLossDaily
- SortinoHyperOptLoss
- SortinoHyperOptLossDaily

Run them in that order and see if you get different results. SharpeHyperOptLoss is a good starting point.

I did find that the built-in loss functions had problems dealing with cases where there are a very low number of trades
with a high average win rate and/or average profit. To help address that, I wrote some custom loss functions, which can
be found in the _hyperopts_ directory. <br>
To use them, you have to copy them to the *freqtrade/user\_data/hyperopts* directory
(which is outside this repository), and then specify one of them using the _-l_ or _--hyperopt-loss_ options.

For example:

> zsh user_data/strategies/scripts/hyp_strat.sh -l WeightedProfitHyperoptLoss binance DWT

The available custom loss functions are:

| Loss Function              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ExpectancyHyperOptLoss     | Optimises based primarily on Expectancy (projected profit per trade)        |
| PEDHyperOptLoss            | Optimises based equally on Profit, Expectancy and Duration                  |
| QuickHyperOptLoss          | Optimises based primarily on average duration of trades (shorter is better) |
| WinHyperOptLoss            | Optimises based primarily on Win/Loss ratio                                 |
| WeightedProfitHyperOptLoss | Optimises based primarily on profit                                         |

All of these functions take multiple parameters into account, they just use different weightings. They also require a
minimum profit, number of trades and win/loss ratio.

I generally use ExpectancyHyperOptLoss, which should produce results that deal better with different datasets, rather
than just the solution that produces the most profit based on the historical data.

## Plotting Results

It is often very useful to see a visual representation of your strategy. You can do this using the plot-dataframe
command:

> freqtrade plot-dataframe --strategy-path _\<path\>_ --strategy _\<strategy\>_  -p BCH/USD --timerange=_\<timerange\>_
> --indicators1 ema5 ema20 --indicators2 mfi

This example creates a plot for pair BCH/USD, adds ema5 and ema20 to the main chart and adds a plot of mfi below that (
these must exist in your dataframe for the strategy). You can find it in the _user_data/plot/_ directory, and in this
case the name of the file would be:
_user_data/plot/freqtrade-plot-BCH_USD-5m.html_
<p>You can open this in a browser, and you can zoom in/out and move around</p>
Any buys and sells generated by backtesting (if any) will be shown on the plot, which is very useful for debugging.

Tip: constrain the plot to a day or 2, otherwise you have to zoom in a lot. Also, when debugging, use the -p option in
backtesting, which will cause the strategy to run only on the pair that you specify, and not across the whole list of
pairs. Also, choose the pair that has the worst performance in your strategy to see where things are going wrong.

## Dry Runs

Easy. In a command window, just run:

> freqtrade trade --dry-run --strategy-path _\<path\>_ --strategy _\<strategy\>_

If you install freqUI (instructions [here](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/rest-api/)), then you can monitor the
trades on a web page at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (or whatever address you specify in config.json)

The script helper is:

> zsh user_data/strategies/scripts/dryrun_strat.sh -p _\<port\>_ _\<exchange\>_ _\<strategy\>_

The -p is optional, but if you want to run multiple strategies on the same exchange you need to use this. In such cases,
there needs to be a matching config file in the base _freqtrade_ directory of the form _
config\_\<exchange\>\_\<port\>.json_, and the port number in the config file must match.

## Live Trading

Just to repeat:

**Never, _ever_, go to live trading without first running the strategy (for at least a week) in a dry run to see how it
performs with real, live data**

For this, you need an account on an exchange, and you need to modify config.json to specify which exchange, trading
limits, private keys etc. You need to get API keys from the exchange website, but that is usually easy.

In a command window, just run:

> freqtrade trade --strategy _\<strategy\>_

The script helper is:

> zsh user_data/strategies/scripts/run_strat -p _\<port\>_ _\<exchange\>_ _\<strategy\>_

You can monitor trades from the UI (see above), and from the exchange website/app

Note that you need your computer synched up to an NTP time source to do this.
